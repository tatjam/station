My personal station website, made with Rust and a very lightweight HTMX, Pico.css frontend.

Rust code is under GPL3, HTML files are released to the public domain. The stylesheet is based on a comment on Pico.css issues by Paul-Louis Pröve [(Link)](https://github.com/picocss/pico/discussions/482#discussioncomment-9043725).
